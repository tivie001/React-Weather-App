## Weather App Assignment - User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to set my location.

- As a user, I want to choose between celius and ferinhight.
- As a user, I want to see a 7 day forcast for my location.
- As a user, I want to be able to see an hourly forcast for a selected day.

## Tips
- Work though the React Tutorial on the [React Website.](reactjs.org)
- Another useful tutorial is [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
- Consider using Create React App to get started.
- Don't let JSX trip you up. [Introducing JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) It is a syntax extension to Javascript and get transpiled to a JS object.
- Don't overlook Hooks. They are a new feature to React that allows developers to use state and other features without having to write a class.
- There are 2 types of React components. Class and function components. Pay attention to the syntax difference. [Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
